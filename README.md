## Introduction

This is the QA2Text dataset. This dataset is built to extract competent triples for knowledge grpah from a triple set which is extracted by OpenIE tool. Here, we utilize a QA dataset for reference question and answer entity. The triples are extracted by MinIE tools. In this dataset, triple's confidence value, head, relation and tail part are taken from this tool's output. Here, we use two types of labeling. One is "Competent" triple (suitable for knowledge graph) and another one is "Incompetent" triple (not suitable for knowledge graph).

## Dataset
QA2Text dataset is available in json format. Here, each triple is stored as a json in a new line. An example entry is shown below:

```json
{"ques": "what kind of money to take to Bahamas?",
        "ans": [
            "Bahamian dollar"
        ],
        "sen": "The Bahamas has its own currency called the Bahamian dollar, but when I visited I'm pretty sure I just used US dollars for every cash transaction.",
        "triple": {
            "con_val": 0.92,
            "head": "The Bahamas",
            "rel": "has",
            "tail": "its own currency called the Bahamian dollar",
            "t_token": [
                "Bahamas",
                "own",
                "currency",
                "Bahamian",
                "dollar"
            ]
        },
        "q_token": [
            "kind",
            "money",
            "Bahamas"
        ],
        "label": "Competent"
}
``` 

* `ques` reference question under which sentence is extracted
* `ans`	answer entity of the each question
* `sen` extracted sentence under each question
* `triple` extracted triple using MinIE tool from the given sentence
* `con_val` confidence value generated by MinIE
* `head` extracted triple's head
* `rel` extracted triple's related part
* `tail` extracted triple's tail
* `t_token` tokens found from the whole triple part (head; rel; tail)
* `q_token` tokens found from the question
* `label` ground-truth label (competent/incompetent)
